# Evaluation_of-_Postfix_Expression
For solving a mathematical expression, we need prefix or postfix form.
After converting infix to postfix, we need postfix evaluation algorithm to find the correct answer.
A postfix expression can be evaluated using the stack data structure.

Postfix expression has the following general structure :- Operand 1 Operand 2 Operator

Example:- ab+
